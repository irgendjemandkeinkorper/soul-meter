# Soul Meter

A dialogue-and-consequence-first CRPG built solo in **Godot 4.7** — a consequence-driven RPG
in Era 3 of the Dramgid Cycle. **2D, isometric, rendered from 3D models.** Design-doc-first;
config name `SoulMeter`.

## Architecture map
<!-- Read THIS instead of grepping to "discover" structure. Load-bearing paths only. -->

- **Engine:** Godot 4.7.1, Forward Plus, Jolt physics. Binary at `~/.local/bin/godot`
  (headless verify: `godot --headless --path . --import` then `--quit-after N`).
- **Entry:** `run/main_scene` = `ui/screens/main_menu.tscn`.
- **Flow (POLICY):** `ui/flow/game_flow.tscn` — the **Godot State Charts** root chart
  (Boot / Menus / Playing:Loading·Active·Paused). UI sends `GameFlow.send_event("...")`;
  **no `change_scene_to_file()` in game code, ever.** SceneLoader (Maaack) is the mechanism.
- **Global state:** `globals/game_state.gd` (`GameState`) — flags, Soul Meter, party,
  inventory, settings. Menus are views of it. `globals/item.gd`, `item_stack.gd`,
  `party_member.gd` are its resources.
- **UI:** `ui/ui_manager.gd` (`UIManager`, mechanism-only screen stack) + `ui/screens/*`
  (Screen base + main_menu/pause/inventory/party/settings).
- **World:** `world/test_room.tscn` (field room) + `actors/player/` (CharacterBody2D).
- **Addons (13):** see `DEPENDENCIES.md` for pins & quirks — Maaack's template, State Charts,
  Pandora, Dialogue Manager, QuestSystem, GLoot, Phantom Camera, Anima, Juicee, SmartShape2D,
  PixelPen (parked on Linux). **Never edit anything under `addons/`.**
- **Art:** `assets/kenney/` (CC0, curated; see its ATTRIBUTION.md).
- **Where NOT to look:** `.godot/`, `.git/`, `*.import`, `dramgid-lore-dump.md` (superseded).

## The architecture spec is `docs/godot-architecture.md`
<!-- The full handoff: layers, plugin stack, sync specs, conventions. Read before building systems. -->

Five layers, dependencies point down only: **Flow (state charts) → Presentation → Systems
(GAS/GLoot/reputation) → Narrative (Dialogue Manager/QuestSystem) → Data (Pandora)**.
Load-bearing rules:

- **Pandora is canonical; nothing writes back.** GLoot prototypes / GAS effects / lookup
  tables are *generated* artifacts — never hand-edit; regenerate from Pandora.
- **Flow:** buttons send events, never name destinations; guards not `if`s; every state pairs
  enter/exit.
- **Reputation:** append-only event log `{actor, faction, delta, cause, scene, timestamp}`;
  standings are derived. One append API.
- **Theming:** theme type variations, no per-node overrides; 9-patch `StyleBoxTexture`.
  The visual language is the Claude design system — see `design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.
- **Combat collision:** in-house hitbox/hurtbox (Area2D pair), GDQuest pattern.
- Also read `docs/godot-flow-handoff.md` (statechart tree detail) and `DEPENDENCIES.md`
  (pins; what's pending: Maaack wizard, Pandora trees, localization, GodotGAS, sync tools).

## The design doc is the spec (game design)

`soul-meter-crpg-design-doc.md` defines [CANON] vs [PROPOSAL]. §6 chassis (field → battle
scene → turn-based) is DECIDED; §9 mandates the serialized game-state singleton (exists:
`GameState`). §10 open canon questions — never resolve silently. ⚠ The doc predates the lore
vault; where they conflict (e.g. Maiiam kidnapped vs withdrawing), flag it — vault wins until
the doc is revised.

## World lore lives in the Dramgid vault (source of truth)

`~/projects/dramgid-vault/` (own git repo): 87 entities. **Read `index.json` first**, open
only the 2–4 entity files the task needs, follow `related` ids. `canon/` + `cosmology/` are
do-not-contradict; `canon/open-questions.md` = deliberate mysteries. Load-bearing for the
game: `cosmology/souls.md` (Soul Gauge = the Soul Meter), `systems/magic-system.md`,
`systems/ten-patron-classes.md`, `systems/character-creation.md`. New lore ⇒ edit entity,
rerun `build_index.py` + `validate.py`.

## Conventions

- GDScript: static typing, `snake_case` files/vars, `PascalCase` nodes/classes; one script
  per node; signals over polling; autoloads for global state.
- Scenes `.tscn`; hand-edit only surgically; keep `uid://` refs intact.
- `rg` over `grep`, `fd` over `find`.

## Working agreement (token discipline)

- Use the map + specs above before searching; a named file/scene/symbol is your pivot.
- Prefer signatures/headings over full bodies; whole-file reads only when editing.
- Side investigations go to a subagent.
- End-of-task: learned something durable → vault note or CLAUDE.md edit (between tasks).

## Do NOT

- Don't edit this file mid-task. Don't read/edit `.godot/`.
- **Don't edit anything under `addons/`.** Don't hand-edit generated `data/generated/*`.
- Don't call `change_scene_to_file()` in game code — send a GameFlow event.
- Don't resolve open canon questions or override [CANON] in code without asking.
- Don't add mechanics without the relevant design-doc/architecture section first.
- Don't reformat/mass-rename outside the task's scope.
